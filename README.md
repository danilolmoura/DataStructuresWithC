# Linear Lists

Data structure in which each element is preceded by one element and followed by another, except the first and last element, and the elements are in a given order.

## Sequential Linear Lists

It is a linear list in which the logical order of the elements is the same as the physical order (in memory) of the elements. That is, neighboring elements in the list will also be neighbors in memory.

## Linked Lists
